## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ ##

While Login Designer is not the first WordPress plugin designed for custom login editing, it offers an unrivaled live-editing experience unlike any other.

I'm talking zero refreshes. Contextually displayed options and plugin settings. Custom event triggers. Context-aware previews. Powerful custom controls. Live editingâ€¦ the list goes on.

Itâ€™s familiar, yet completely revolutionary. Click on any element from your login page to fine tune it. That elementâ€™s settings are contextually displayed, while otherâ€™s hide. This way, youâ€™ll spend less time navigating the Customizerâ€™s sections and panels, and more time actually fine-tuning your websiteâ€™s login page.
